# Astroinformatics Practices

This repository contains scripts and outputs from 4 practices of the Astroinformatics course, where we work with a TESS light curve analysis project. The course is part of the Master's program in Astronomy at Universidad de Antofagasta. Each practice is organized into its own folder (`practice1/`, `practice2/`, etc.) and includes code, scripts, figures, and data files.

---
First you must install the packages that are used in the codes, these are in the requirements.txt file and to install it you must type in the terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## üìÅ practice1

This folder contains the initial preparation of TESS light curve data. The steps involved are as follows:

1. **Download light curves**:  
   - Use the Bash script `tesscurl_sector_73_lc.sh` to download light curve `.fits` files from TESS Sector 73 via the MAST archive.

2. **Convert `.fits` to `.csv`**:  
   - Open the `.fits` files in TOPCAT to convert them into `.csv` format.
   - Select only the relevant columns (e.g., TIME, FLUX, FLUX_ERR).

3. **Organize the `.csv` files**:  
   - Use a Bash script to generate a list of all `.csv` filenames.
   - Use another script to split this list into smaller files containing 5 entries each, for easier batch processing.

These steps prepare the data for further analysis in the following practices.

## üìÅ practice2

This folder includes Bash scripts for automated data preparation:

- Scripts to:
  - Change delimiters in `.csv` files.
  - Rename file extensions from `.csv` to `.lc`.
  - Remove irrelevant columns from light curve files.
- A script that classifies stars into spectral types based on temperature.
- A script that calculates Julian Dates from calendar dates.

## üìÅ practice3

This practice focuses on Python-based analysis of light curves:

- Scripts to plot light curves from `.lc` files with improved readability.
- Code to identify and highlight outliers in the plots.
- Functions to compute basic light curve statistics (e.g., amplitude, standard deviation).

---

## üìÅ practice4

This final practice focuses on documentation and repository organization:

- Creation of this GitHub repository containing all previous graded practices.
- A short documentation file describing the light curve processing steps.
- A list of defined test cases to verify the correctness of light curve processing scripts.

---

Each folder is self-contained and corresponds to one graded practice of the course.
