# Practice 1 Astroinformatics
This repository contains scripts and outputs from Practice 1 of the TESS light curve analysis project.  In this practice, we worked with photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), specifically from Sector 73, to extract and visualize light curves with TOPCAT software.
